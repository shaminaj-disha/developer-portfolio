            <p>You might saw me eating, sleeping, reading, cooking, drawing and watching movies/series. But nobody pays
                me a dime for that
                work. That's why I am learning and mastering web development. I will not stop until I become the Web
                Development Hero.</p>

            <p>I already learned the basic HTML and CSS. I can now build any simple website. I can even teach a grandma
                how
                to make simple websites. Right now, my goal is to build 3 websites and learn advanced topics.</p>

                <p>I am the master of HTML, CSS and Javascript. I know everything needed to make a website function,
                    efficient. I didn't stop with the web. I went beyond with most popular Javascript framework called
                    Vue
                    JS. I even know the deployment, server and security. I will give you 100% web solution.</p>

                <p>They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remote web developer. I made their website and
                    showed
                    it to them. They liked it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming Hero.</p>
